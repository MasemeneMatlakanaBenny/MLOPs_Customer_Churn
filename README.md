# Churn ML System
The **Churn ML System** is a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a customer will leave or stay at the organization.  
This project includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **deployment-ready artifacts**, making it suitable for real-world ML system design.

---


## Motivation
  
This system uses **machine learning** to:

- Predict whether someone will churn or not
-Validate the capabilities and probabilities of a customer churning
-The model's value to the business
-Deploy the model in production
---

## Project Overview

The system performs the following:

1. **Load and clean loan application data**
2. **Engineer useful features**
3. **Train multiple ML models**
4. **Compare and evaluate model performance**
5. **Export trained models for inference**
6. Prepare for **deployment or integration** with APIs
